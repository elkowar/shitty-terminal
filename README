st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X.

Enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):

    make clean install

My fork has support for:
                    Xresources
                    ligatures
                    scrollback
                    colored emojis
                    w3m image previews
                    second font
                    external pipe and more.

Unfortunately I could not patch it for transparency. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
